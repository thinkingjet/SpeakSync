# Project Brief: Real-time Translation Meeting Room

## Overview
This project aims to create a real-time meeting room application that eliminates language barriers by enabling seamless communication between people who speak different languages. The system will automatically detect spoken language, translate it in real-time, and deliver the translation to other users in their preferred language.

## Core Requirements
- Real-time video and audio communication
- Live speech detection and translation without waiting for pauses
- Voice cloning to preserve speaker characteristics across translations
- Multi-user translation "rooms" where users join and set their preferred language
- Automatic meeting notes generation in each user's preferred language
- Support for multilingual speakers who switch languages mid-sentence
- Text chat with automatic translation
- Responsive design for various devices

## Goals
- Create a seamless, intuitive user experience with minimal latency
- Ensure high-quality audio and translation accuracy
- Preserve speaker's voice characteristics and emotional tone
- Enable natural conversation flow across language barriers
- Provide useful meeting documentation that captures key points
- Scale to accommodate various meeting sizes
- Support users who speak multiple languages and switch between them

## Target Audience
- International businesses and remote teams
- Educational institutions with diverse language speakers
- Global events and conferences
- Diplomatic and governmental communications
- Individual users communicating with international contacts

## Success Criteria
- Low latency translation (under 1-2 seconds)
- High translation accuracy
- Natural-sounding voice synthesis that preserves speaker characteristics
- Smooth handling of language switching mid-conversation
- Accurate and concise automated meeting notes
- Intuitive user interface
- Stable connections with minimal disruptions
- Responsive performance across devices
